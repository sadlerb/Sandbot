# Sandbot
A discord bot that I built to do random things for fun

Commands:

    $inspire - Receive a inspiring message
    
    $new <quote>  - Send the users qoute to a mongo database
    
    $list - View all quotes in the database 
    
    $del <quoteID> - Delete a qoute from the database 


  
  Planned: 
  
     A Command to create a poll
     
     A search for a word or sentense on google 

     ``add news api``
     Allow search by category 

     very advanced decision making

     to do lists
